 nce1-16.A polite request.解析出来有问题

I found this note on my car: 'Sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a 'No Parking'  area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.' If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!

'No Parking'  会被截断
